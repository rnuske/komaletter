Letters are fairly standardized products and as such lend themselves to be 
written in Markdown. This package is heavily based on [linl](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=linl)
but it wraps the very configurable KOMA-Script class *scrlttr2* instead of the
standard LaTeX document class *letter*.
 
*komaletter* strives to turn a simple R Markdown document together with a layout
definition into a beautiful letter (PDF). Layout definitions can be one of 
KOMA-Script's standard styles, the package default style or a user defined style. For more details refer to the section [Letter Layouts](#letter-layouts). 

Various aspects of the letter can be determined via variables in the R Markdown
document metadata (aka YAML header), see [Letter settings](#letter-settings).


## Usage
An easy way to start a new *komaletter* is to ask for the skeleton document
in RStudio via *New File > R Markdown > From Template > komaletter* or 
`rmarkdown::draft("myletter.Rmd", template="pdf", package="komaletter")`. 
To turn the markown in a beautiful PDF use the Knit Button in RStudio or `rmarkdown::render("myletter.Rmd")`.

The skeleton creates a very simple letter as a starting point for your own
writing. Several formatting defaults for font, fontsize, indentation are in use.
The following figure shows the complete source on the left and the rendered PDF
on the right.

## Letter Settings
Various aspects of the letter can be customized via the following
variables in the R Markdown document metadata (aka YAML header).

Although it rarely makes sense to write a letter without sender and recipient,
a komaletter can be constructed by merely specifying the output format.
All other variables are optional.


Variable         | Description
---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------
author           | Writer of the letter
return-address   | Address of the sender; takes a list for a multi-line address.
address          | Name and address of the recipient; takes a list.
date             | Custom date; if not specified, current date will be inserted.
subject          | Subject line.
opening          | Text for the salutation.
closing          | Text for the complementary close.
signature        | Typed signature or image placed below closing.
signature-before | Allows adjustment of vertical space before signature.

Table: Most commonly used variables.


All variables understood by `rmarkdown`'s `pdf_document` format may be used 
in addition to the `komaletter` variables defined in the following table 
to further customize your letter. These variables do not change the placement
of elements of the letter (address, letter head, text). For those aspects 
refer to [Letter Layouts](#letter-layouts).

Variable     | Description
------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------
lco          | Letter Class Option File (cf. [Letter Layouts](#letter-layouts)).
lang         | Language code according to [BCP 47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) (e.g. `en` or `en-GB`).
papersize    | Size of paper eg. `a4`, `letter`.
return-phone | Phone number of sender used in letter head.
return-email | Email address of sender used in letter head.
return-url   | Website of sender used in letter head.
place        | Sender’s place used near date.
yourref      | Addressee’s reference as part of reference line.
yourmail     | Date of addressee’s referenced mail as part of reference line.
myref        | Sender’s reference as part of reference line.
customer     | Customer number as part of reference line.
invoice      | Invoice number as part of reference line.
cc           | Recipients to be carbon-copied; can take a list.
encl         | List of enclosures.
ps           | Text to be added at the end of the letter as a postscript.
komaoption   | Specify further KOMA options; takes a list (see [KOMA-Script documentation](https://komascript.de/~mkohm/scrguien.pdf)).
parskip      | Defines how to mark new paragraphs, e.g. full, half, off (see [KOMA-Script documentation](https://komascript.de/~mkohm/scrguien.pdf)).

## Letter Layouts
The layout of letters is defined in so-called **Letter Class Option** files.
KOMA-Script provides a number of standard styles (see following table). 
The package comes with a default style defined in *maintainersDelight.lco*. 
Users may as well define there own layout.

Styles can be selected via the variable `lco` in the YAML header of the
rmarkdown document. Provide either the name of one of the standard styles 
listed below or the path to a self defined style without file extension. 
If LaTeX can not find the **lco** file, it uses KOMA-Script's default: **DIN**. 
Common errors besides typos are paths *with* extension, underscores in paths
mangeled by pandoc.

Custom *lco's* may be constructed either based on one of the standard lco-files
or by defining all aspects such as position of the recpients address, 
foldmarks etc.. For a comprehensive description refer to the 
[KOMA-Script Guide](https://komascript.de/~mkohm/scrguien.pdf).



Country       | Standard     | Window Envelope  | Paper Size | lco
------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ---------- | ----------------
Germany       | DIN 676      | DIN lang, C4, C5 | A4         | DIN, DINmtext
France        | NF Z 11-001  | DL               | A4         | NF
Switzerland   | SN 010 130   | DIN lang, C4, C5 | A4         | SN, SNleft
United States |              | commercial #9    | Letter     | UScommercial9, UScommercial9DW
Japan         |              | Chou/You 3 & 4   | A4         | NipponEL, ...

## Hints
* The default papersize of KOMA-Script class *scrlttr2* is DIN A4. If you want to create an US style letter eg. using `lco: UScommercial9`, remember to set the papersize to `letter`.
* If you plan on writing non-english letters using _i.e._ `lang: de`, make sure you have the necessary LaTeX language packs, _i.e._ `texlive-lang-german`.
* Since the figure environment is not defined in the classes `letter` and `scrlltr2`, pandoc has to be told not to wrap the image into `\begin{figure}...\end{figure}`. Which can be achieved by ending the line with a backslash:
```
![Alt text](image.png)\ 
```
If you just want a regular inline image, just make sure it is not the only thing in  the  paragraph. One way to do this is to insert a nonbreaking space after the image:
```
![This image won't be a figure](/url/of/image.png)\
```
