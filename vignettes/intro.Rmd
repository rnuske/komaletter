Letters are fairly standardized products and as such lend themselves to be 
written in Markdown. This package is heavily based on [linl](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=linl)
but it wraps the very configurable KOMA-Script class *scrlttr2* instead of the
standard document class *letter*.
 
*komaletter* strives to turn a simple R Markdown document together with a layout
definition into a beautiful letter (PDF). Layout definitions can be one of 
KOMA-Script's standard styles, the package default style or a user defined style. For more details refer to [Letter Layouts](#letter-layouts). 

Various aspects of the letter can be determined via variables in the R Markdown
document metadata (aka YAML frontmatter), cf. [Letter settings](#letter-settings).


## Usage
An easy way to start a komaletter is to ask for the skeleton document in RStudio 
via *New File > R Markdown > From Template > komaletter* or 
`rmarkdown::draft("myletter.Rmd", template="pdf", package="komaletter")`. 
After the letter is written `rmarkdown::render("myletter.Rmd")` creates the 
final PDF.

The skeleton creates a very simple letter.  This shows the (complete) source 
on the left and the rendered pdf on the right:

## Letter settings
Various aspects of the letter can be customized by setting the following
variables in the R Markdown document metadata (aka YAML frontmatter).

Variable         | Description
---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------
author           | Writer of the letter
return-address   | Address of the sender; takes a list for a multi-line address.
address          | Name and address of the recipient; takes a list.
date             | Custom date; if not specified, current date will be inserted.
subject          | Subject line.
opening          | Text for the salutation.
closing          | Text for the complementary close.
signature        | Typed signature or image placed below closing.
signature-before | Allows adjustment of vertical space before signature.

Table: Most commonly used variables.


All variables understood by the rmarkdown pdf format may be used in addition 
to the komaletter variables defined in the following table to further customize
letters. These variables do not change the placement of the elements of the 
letter (address, letter head, text). For those aspects refer to 
[Letter Layouts](#letter-layouts).

Variable     | Description
------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------
lco          | Letter Class Option File (cf. [Letter Layouts](#letter-layouts)).
lang         | Language code according to [BCP 47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) (e.g. `en` or `en-GB`).
papersize    | Size of paper eg. `a4`, `letter`.
return-phone | Phone number of sender used in letter head.
return-email | Email address of sender used in letter head.
return-url   | Website of sender used in letter head.
place        | Sender’s place used near date.
yourref      | Addressee’s reference as part of reference line.
yourmail     | Date of addressee’s referenced mail as part of reference line.
myref        | Sender’s reference as part of reference line.
customer     | Customer number as part of reference line.
invoice      | Invoice number as part of reference line.
cc           | Recipients to be carbon-copied; can take a list.
encl         | List of enclosures.
ps           | Text to be added at the end of the letter as a postscript.
komaoption   | Specify further KOMA options; takes a list (see [KOMA-Script documentation](https://komascript.de/~mkohm/scrguien.pdf)).
parskip      | Defines how to mark new paragraphs, e.g. full, half, off (see [KOMA-Script documentation](https://komascript.de/~mkohm/scrguien.pdf)).

## Letter Layouts
The layout of letters is usually defined in so-called **Letter Class Option** 
files. KOMA-Script provides a number of standard styles, cf. following table.
Useres may define there own style and the package comes with a default style 
defined in *maintainers_delight.lco*.

Styles can be selected via the variable `lco` in the YAML header of the
rmarkdown document. Provide either the name of one of the standard styles 
listed below or the path to a self defined styles without file extension. 
If LaTeX can not find the *lco*, it uses KOMA-Script's default: DIN. 
Common errors besides typos are paths *with* extension, underscores in paths
mangeled by pandoc.

Custom *lco's* may be constructed either based on one of the standard lco-files
or by defining all aspects such as position of the recpients address, 
foldmarks etc.. For a comprehensive description refer to the 
[KOMA-Script Guide](https://komascript.de/~mkohm/scrguien.pdf).

## Hints
* The default papersize of KOMA-Script class *scrlttr2* is DIN A4. If you want to create an US style letter eg. using `lco: UScommercial9`, remember to set the papersize to `letter`.
* Since the figure environment is not defined in the classes `letter` and `scrlltr2`, pandoc has to be told not wrap the image into `\begin{figure}...\end{figure}`. Which can be achieved by ending the line with a backslash:
```
![Alt text](image.png)\ 
```
If you just want a regular inline image, just make sure it is not the only thing in  the  paragraph. One way to do this is to insert a nonbreaking space after the image:
```
![This image won't be a figure](/url/of/image.png)\
```
